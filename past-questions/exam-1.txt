Task 1: (Wireless Security – Basics and Jamming) 3+4+3 points
a) Why is security by proximity a flawed security strategy? Explain on an example.
b) Name a protocol aware jamming attack and a protocol oblivious jamming attack on 802.11a Wi-Fi. Explain the differences between a protocol aware jamming attack and a protocol oblivious jamming attack
with regards to 802.11a Wi-Fi.
c) Name two techniques that make wireless communication more robust against narrow-band jamming
attacks. Pick one and explain: Why does this technique result in a less potential overall data rate for that
communication?
Task 2: (Wireless Security – Wi-Fi Security) 2+2+4+2 points
a) Which of the following statements are true and which are false? Use the symbols T (true) and F (false) to
answer this question.
_ Open System Authentication describes a method, where any client can connect to a Wi-Fi network
without knowledge of any secrets.
_ An access point of a Wi-Fi network secured by MAC-address filtering only accepts connections by
devices using a MAC address matching to its pre-set list of MAC addresses.
_ WEP supports the different keylengths 32 bits, 40 bits, and 104 bits.
_ WEP's successor WPA was a major redesign of which WPA2 adopted most aspects, eventhough WPA
still used the broken RC4.
b) What weakness of RC4 does the FMS attack exploit?
c) You are eavesdropping all nearby Wi-Fi packets. You notice a WEP encrypted communication between
two devices. What packets can you use to perform the FMS attack as presented in the lecture? Explain
what makes these packets usable.
d) What makes the WPA2 handshake vulnerable?
Task 3: (Side Channels) 3+2+5 points
a) Describe the difference between the side channels and covert channels.
b) Compared to brute forcing a cryptographic algorithm, what advantage do side channels provide?
c) What side channel enables the padding oracle attack presented in the lecture? Which information is
leaked?
Task 4: (Threat Intelligence) 2+6+2 points
a) What characteristics of Indicators of Compromise are visualized by the "Pyramid of Pain"?
b) Name the main motivation for each Threat Actor type.
c) What is the idea behind Supply Chain Attacks?

Task 5: (Group Key Management) 2+2+3+3 points
k2,0
k1,0
u1 u2
k2,1 k2,2 k2,3
k1,1
k0,0
u3 u4
The key tree above is used for the key management of a group G with the user ui, i ∈ {1,2,3,4}. The members
of the group are associated with leafs of the key tree. Each node in the key tree contains a secret key. All
members of the sub-tree rooted at node v know the key stored in the node v. The key k0,0 stored in the root
of the tree is the group key.
a) A group controller uses the LKH (Logical Key Hierarchy) protocol and the tree in the figure for the key
management. Write down the keys known by the user u3.
b) The user u5 joins the group and is added to the tree at the position of the user u3 (in the figure).
Hence, k2,2 moves to k3,4. Draw the modified tree.
c) Now the modified tree from task (b) is used for the key management. The user u2 leaves the group.
A group controller uses the LKH protocol (group oriented) for the key update. Specify the broadcast
message of the group controller that enables remaining members to calculate the new group key.
d) Now the TGDH (Tree Based Group Diffie Hellman) protocol and the tree in the figure is used for the
key management. Write down the keys known by the user u4.s
Task 6: (Secret Sharing) 3+3+3+1 points
a) Write down different types of secret sharing and describe their main two features.
b) Given a 5-out-of-5 RSA signature algorithm with the public key (e, ñ), the secret (private) keys (di, ñ) of
user ui, i ∈ {1,2,3,4,5} and the (RSA) modulus ñ = p·q (p,q large primes). Write down the multi-signature
generation equations for a message m.
c) Write down the multi-signature verification equation for the 5-out-of-5 RSA signature.
d) Name an application for the n-out-of-n RSA signature.
Task 7: (Distributed Ledger/Blockchain) 2+2+6 points
a) What is a blockchain?
b) What is the task of miners in a blockchain-based distributed ledger?
c) Describe a blockchain-based distributed ledger operation.

Table 1: Details about some certificates
The certificate authority J issues the certificates listed in table 1.
a) The certificate authority (CA) A publishes revocation information in the form of CRLs. A complete CRL is
always generated at the first day of the month. Please specify the CRLs issued in June, July and August
2020 if the following certificate are revoked.
B 03/06/2020
E 05/06/2020
T 14/06/2020
G 11/07/2020
H 24/07/2020
b) The CA J introduces delta CRLs. The delta CRLs are issued twice a month, on the 10th and 20th of each
month. Please write down the delta CRLs in June and July 2020.

Task 9: (Privacy) 10 points
Which of the following statements are true and which are false? Use the symbols T (true) and F (false) to
answer this question.
_ After anonymizing a dataset using multivariate microaggregation, anomaly detection is always possible.
_ Pseudonymization always makes it impossible to link an individual to certain data anymore.
_ The GDPR demands that anonymous data is protected from being used for purposes different from the
purpose the plaintext data have been collected for.
_ A release of data is said to have the k-anonymity property if the information for each person contained
in the release cannot be distinguished from at least k -1 individuals whose information also appear in
the release.
_ In the context of privacy and data protection, the GDPR is the abbreviation of "guide of data protection
and privacy respectation".
_ Global recoding is an appropriate technique for numerical data. The values of the data attributes are
simply replaced with summary statistics.
_ Local recoding allows for replacing values of data attributes with summary statistics of values of other
data attributes.
_ Pseudonymization should be preferred over anonymization in all use cases.
_ In the clustering phase of multivariate microaggregation, each value of one single data attribute is made
indistinguishable from k-1 other values of different data attributes in the same dataset.
_ The anonymization technique “suppression” would always preserve the highest possible utility of a dataset.
Task 10: (Anomaly Detection) 2+8 points
a) Which of the following statements are true and which are false? Use the symbols T (true) and F (false)
to answer this question.
_ In general, data deformation can improve the detection quality of k-means and linear SVMs but
not for the DBScan algorithm.
_ In a worst case scenario, the runtime of DBScan is in O(#pts * dim).
b) Provide the algorithms for DBScan and k-means (including the input parameters). In each of the resulting models, which points are predicted "abnormal"?

Task 11: (Statistics) 4+6 points
Which of the following statements are true and which are false? Use the symbols T (true) and F (false) to
answer this question.
_ The values of an ordinal data type come with a natural ordering.
_ The average positive ratio is the harmonic mean.
_ The correlation measures the unnormalized variability of two random variables.
_ In the t-test, we have to assume that the two given groups are approximately normally distributed.

50,000 files are infected. The virus scanner scans all unencrypted files. Fill out the confusion matrix and compute the accuracy of the virus scanner.
