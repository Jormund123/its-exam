Frage 1 - Jamming Attacks (2 Punkte)
Which of the following attacks are protocol aware jamming attacks?
Barrage Jamming
Preamble Corruption
Pilot Jamming
Control Information Jamming
Frage 2 - Security by Proximity (2 Punkte)
Why is "Security by Proximity" a flawed security concept?
The received signal power at a receiver is not solely controlled by the sender.
Protocol aware jamming is an attack specifically designed to break PKES.
Inconsistent bit error rates make proximity based protocols too unreliable for practical security.
Relay attacks can fake physical proximity.
Most of the time it is infeasible to prevent an attacker from getting too close to your system.
Frage 3 - Effects of physical layer attacks (2.04 Punkte)
Assign the following effects to the three given physical layer attack techniques.
Frage 4 - Narrow-band jamming mitigation (2 Punkte)
Fill in the gaps of the text (using drag and drop).
To counteract narrow-band jamming attacks wireless systems can employ several mitigation techniques.
Frage 5 - Padding Oracle (4 Punkte)
Perform a padding oracle attack on the cipher under http://itsecexam.tonejc.de:8421/Exam1/281 .
The instructions are on the webpage. Write the decrypted plaintext here
Frage 6 - RSA I (1 Punkt)
When computing RSA digital signatures, modular exponentiation needs to be performed. Which method is used in a straightforward implementation?
Exponentiate and reduce
Divide and Multiply
Double and Add
Square and Multiply
Cryptography.Math.ModExp
Frage 7 - RSA II (2.04 Punkte)
Which side channel attacks can be used for the above method? Select all that apply.
Timing attack
Power analysis
Chosen plaintext attack
Chosen ciphertext attack
Bias detection using machine learning
Cache timing
Frage 8 - key concepts of information security (1.002 Punkte)

To which type of Threat Intelligence do Indicators of Compromise belong?
Operational
Tactical
Strategic

Following an attacker's steps to reconstruct the attack.
Scanning a system for Indicators of Compromise.
Obtaining information about a target through third-party sources.
Placing a tracking pixel in a website's footer.
