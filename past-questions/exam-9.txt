Decide for each statement, whether it is true (T) or false (F) by marking it with the corresponding
letter.
_ Research in Usable Security and Privacy uses interview, survey, and experimental studies
to investigate how human factors impact privacy and security.
_ Software users are the root cause of most IT security problems.
_ Software developers are the root cause of most IT security problems.
_ Most software developers are security experts.
_ Informed consent means that study participants need to have sufficient information and
understanding about a study, before deciding to take part in it.
_ In the SOUPS-paper,,...no one can hack my mind': Comparing Expert and Non-Expert Security practices" by Ion et. al., security experts recommend using two-factor authentication
more frequently than non-experts do.

Exercise 4 (Applied Binary Exploitation, 10 points). Given the following information, prepare the
payload to overflow the local variable x to exploit a program with a ROP chain which calls execve
("/bin/sh", NULL, NULL). Write it into the column„Stack at Position 2“ along with very
brief explanations of each word. The exploit should be designed for a little-endian x64 architecture
with System V calling convention.
Base Address of library: 0x7fff 4000 0000
Gadget offsets:
pop rax; ret
pop rdi; pop rdx; ret
pop rsi; ret
syscall

String "/bin/sh\0" address: Ox7fff f7ff dab0
execve() syscall:
rax -- 0x3b
rdi -- const char *filename
rsi -- const char *argv []
rdx -- const char *envp []
You can assume that the executed code is equivalent to the following Pseudo-C snippet and that there
are no stack canaries or mitigations active:
1 void func() {
2 unsigned long x = 42;
3
4 // Position 1
5
6 read(stdin, &x, 8 * 16);
7
8 // Position 2
You may write a dash (-) instead of a 00.
