Exercise 3 (Usable Security and Privacy, 4+6 points).
a) Your colleagues are planning a survey study about peoples' attitudes towards clientside scanning,
and have asked for your feedback. For the following questions in bold font below, apart from
self-reporting bias, judge which questions are methodologically sound, and which are problematic
enough, that you would recommend your colleagues to improve the question, before publishing
and distributing their survey.
At the beginning of the survey, your colleagues present a neutral definition of clientside scanning:
„There is software that allows comprehensive automated searches for files relevant to criminal
activities on devices such as smartphones or laptops. Law enforcement authorities are informed
if the software finds suspicious material."
If you judge a question or its answers to be problematic, briefly explain the problematic aspects.

b) Decide for each statement, whether it is true (T) or false (F) by marking it with the corresponding
letter.
_ Software developers are the root cause of most IT security problems.
_ Using snowball sampling to recruit participants leads to an unbiased, random sample.
_ Most software developers are not security experts.
_ From an ethical point of view, study participants need to have sufficient information and
understanding about a study, before deciding to take part in it.
_ In the SOUPS-paper „Replication: No One Can Hack My Mind: Revisiting a Study on
Expert and Non-Expert Security Practices and Advice" by Busse et. al., security experts
recommend not sharing private information more frequently than non-experts do.

Exercise 4 (Applied Binary Exploitation, 10 points). Given the following information, prepare the
payload to overflow the local variable x to exploit a program with a ROP chain which calls libc's
system("/bin/sh"). Write the bytes of the payload correctly into „Stack at Position 26
and briefly explain each stack word on the right. The exploit should be designed for a littleendian x64 architecture with System V calling convention.
Base Address of library: Ox7fff 4000 0000
Gadget offsets:
pop rdx; ret 0x1000
mov rdi, rsp; ret -- Oxdead
add rdi, rdx; ret -- 0x001e
-- 0x01 00e8 system() offset
system():
rdi -- const char *command
You can assume that the executed code is equivalent to the following Pseudo-C snippet and that there
are no stack canaries active. However, the position of the stack is randomized, so you cannot
use absolute stack addresses.

Exercise 9 (Device Identification, 3+3+4 points).
Matriculation Number:
a) Give an example for why utilizing device identification techniques can benefit an offensive actor
as discussed in the lecture. In what way can the target device and/or its holder be compromised

in that scenario. Why does it work? What drawbacks does your suggested technique have?
