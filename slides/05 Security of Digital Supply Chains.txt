THREATS & THREAT ACTORS
CYBER THREAT
,, Any circumstance or event with the potential to
adversely impact organizational operations […],
organizational assets, individuals, other
organizations, or the Nation through an
information system […]”
NIST - Cyber Threat Definition
WS2025 5Software Supply Chain Attacks / Marc Ohm / IT Security
THREAT ACTOR
,,A threat actor […] is an entity that is […]
responsible for an incident that impacts – or has
the potential to impact – an organization's security”

TYPES OF THREAT ACTORS
THREAT ACTOR
Hacktivists
Terrorist Groups
Thrill-Seeker*
▪ Lowest level of sophistication
▪ Rely on widely available tools that require little
technical skill to deploy
▪ Their actions, more often than not, have no lasting
effect on their targets beyond reputation
▪ *also called script-kiddies

TYPES OF THREAT ACTORS
THREAT ACTOR
Cybercriminals
▪ Moderate sophistication
▪ Nonetheless, they still have
▪ Planning and support functions
▪ Specialized technical capabilities that affect a large
number of victims

TYPES OF THREAT ACTORS
THREAT ACTOR
Nation-State
▪ The most sophisticated threat actors
▪ virtually unlimited resources
▪ dedicated personnel
▪ extensive planning and coordination
https://cyber.gc.ca/en/guidance/cyber-threat-and-cyber-threat-actors
WS2025 Software Supply Chain Attacks / Marc Ohm / IT Security
10
TYPES OF THREAT ACTORS
THREAT ACTOR
▪ Working within the targeted organization
▪ Particularly dangerous because of their access to
internal networks
▪ Access is a key component for malicious threat
actors
▪ Having privileged access eliminates the need to
employ other remote means
▪ Insider threats may be associated with any of the
other listed types
▪ Or just a disgruntled employee with motive
