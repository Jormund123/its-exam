USER AUTHENTICATION
IT Security
USER AUTHENTICATION
Definition: Authentication is the act of proving the identity of a computer system user. In
contrast with identification (the act of indicating a person’s/thing's identity) authentication is
the process of verifying that identity.
Attributes
− Usability / Comfort: how easy it is for the right person to authenticate
− Security: how hard it is for the wrong person to authenticate
− Privacy: how much private data one has to give away to authenticate
− Intrusiveness: level of interference in one’s private sphere required to authenticate
− Risk: the risk level the holder of authenticated asset is exposed to (compliance +
regulations set thresholds)
− Cost: how much it costs to set up, maintain, and support
IT Security 9
AUTHENTICATION FACTORS
− Something you know: typically passwords, PINs, password phrases
− Something you have: car key, credit card, bank OTP token, mobile phone, identity card, passport
− Something you are: biometrics, e.g. fingerprints, retinas, passport photo, 3D face scan
AUTHENTICATION METHODS
Single factor: mostly passwords, occasionally biometrics (e.g. fingerprint) or object (e.g. access
card)
Multi factor: any combination of two or more factors, typically a password plus another factor
Conditional: dynamic, most of the time single factor, with an additional factor required in case of
anomalies
(Password less: buzzword used in marketing of delegated solutions that minimize the use of the
password)
(Delegated: also marketing, when using Google or Microsoft or Facebook to authenticate the user)

PASSWORDS
IT Security
PASSWORD THREATS
− Loss of confidentiality of passwords = compromised passwords
− Malware at user client (keylogger, info stealer, …)
− Phishing, trick users to provide passwords to attackers
− Password database theft (password hashes or cleartext)
IT Security 14
(GENERAL) PROPERTIES OF THREATS
Compromised passwords could be changed
after compromise detection ?
Property
avoidable detectable repairable
Threat
Loss of confidentiality yes no no
Loss of integrity no yes yes
Loss of availability no yes yes

PASSWORD THREAT MANAGEMENT
− Detect compromises
1. Threat intelligence: investigate which passwords are known by criminals and
warn affected users / service providers (aka leak checking)
2. Detect password database theft using Honeywords

 Alice authenticates by submitting
her password P
 The computer system checks her
password against all those it
stores
 If a match is found, the index of
that match is sent to the
honeychecker for verification

authenticated

Honeywords: Verification
 An attacker will submit a sweetword
 The computer system checks the

#RSAC
Honeywords: Verification Rule
 If true password Pi submitted, user authentication succeeds.
 Submitted password P’ not in P1 … Pn is handled as typical
password authentication failure.
 If honeyword Pj is submitted, an alarm is raised by the
honeychecker.
 This is strong indication of theft of password hash file!
 Honeywords (if properly chosen) will rarely be submitted otherwise.
 No change in the user experience!

11 RULES OF NIST PASSWORD GUIDELINES
− Last Revision in 2024
1. Use a password manager
2. Password length is always greater than complexity
− No weird password rules
3. Choose the „Show password while typing“ option
4. Breached password protection (incl. leak checking)
5. Keep your password safe with salting and hashing
6. Do not use password hints
IT Security 32
11 RULES OF NIST PASSWORD GUIDELINES
7. Do not change passwords fequently
8. − No forced resets (mostly)
Limit the number of password attempts
9. Use multi factor authentication
10. Give feedback explaining why you rejected a password
11. Keep special character rules in passwords
− No weird password rules
IT Security 33
SESSION MANAGEMENT
IT Security
SESSIONS AND SESSION SECRETS
− After successful authentication users want to continue using the application
across multiple subsequent interactions without requiring them to repeat
authentication
− Session occurs between user software (e.g. browser) and (web) service provider
− session secret
− is shared between these two parties
− allows user software to continue using the service over time
− Browser cookies are the predominant mechanism by which sessions are created
and tracked
IT Security 35
SESSION (COOKIE) HIJACKING
− Session threats
− Loss of confidentiality of session secrect (cookie)
− Malware at user client (keylogger, info stealer, …)
− (strong authentication does not prevent session hijacking)
− we see stolen cookies in threat intelligence data
− Is a warning system (like for passwords) useful?
