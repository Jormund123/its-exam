4 / 57
What are Side Channels
■ Based on (non-intentional) physical information
■ Can be inherent or induced
■ Can enable new kinds of attacks
5 / 57
Side Channels vs. Covert Channels
Side channels ⇒Interception/Wiretapping
The goal is to obtain the internal information about the system.
The attacker is often passive.
Covert channels ⇒Communication
The goal is to exfiltrate the information.
They require an active attacker.
A side channel can be used as a building block for a covert channel.
6 / 57
Types of Side Channels
■ Timing (Kocher 1996)
■ Power (KJJ 1999)
■ Electromagnetic radiation (UCL &Gemplus 2001)
■ Temperature (Naccache 2009)
■ Light (Kuhn 2002)
■ Sound (Shamir & Tromer 2004)
■ Photonic emissions (TU Berlin 2012)

Some Unusual Side Channels
■ Keyboard clicks can be distinguished by a cell phone’s mi-
crophone [2]
■ In former East Germany, a page with all possible characters
was typed by each typewriter that was produced to trace
them later

Types of Attacks
■ Active vs. passive
■ Exploit abnormal behavior
■ Insertion of signals/glitches
■ Normal operation
■ Reading hidden signals
■ Invasive vs. non-invasive
■ Side-channel attacks are usually passive and non-invasive
9 / 57
Why it Works
Leakage is exploitable due to
■ dependency on sequences of instructions executed
■ dependency on data being processed
■ other physical effects
■ ability to work on one small part at a time
10 / 57
Levels of Analysis
■ Simple: just one measurement
■ Differential: multiple measurements, correlate
■ Higher order: different samples
■ Combining several side-channels
■ Combining with theoretical cryptanalysis

Measuring Timing Variations
■ The duration depends on secret data
■ Conditions:
■ Can correlate correct guesses with observed timings
■ Can work one bit/one byte at a time
■ Averaging over several measurements to reduce the noise
17 / 57
RSA
■ Public key (n, e), secret key (p, q, d)
■ n = p·q, e·d ≡1 (mod (p−1)(q−1)), n has k + 1 bits
■ To sign a message m, compute
md mod n,
using e.g. Square-and-Multiply (simplified):
Set y ←1, s ←m
For bits d0, d1, . . . , dk of d:
If di = 1:
or
y ←y·s mod n
s ←s2 mod n
Return y
Set y ←1
For bits dk, dk−1, . . . , d0 of d:
y ←y2 mod n
If di = 1:
y ←y·m mod n
Return y
18 / 57
RSA
■ Public key (n, e), secret key (p, q, d)
■ n = p·q, e·d ≡1 (mod (p−1)(q−1)), n has k + 1 bits
■ To sign a message m, compute
md mod n,
using e.g. Square-and-Multiply (simplified):
Set y ←1, s ←m
For bits d0, d1, . . . , dk of d:
If di = 1:
or
y ←y·s mod n
s ←s2 mod n

y ←y·m mod n
Return y

Timing Attack
■ Each signature takes time T= e +
k
∑
i=0
ti
■ Guess the first b bits of d
■ Predict the time given the guess and subtract from T
■ Compute variance of the difference over all samples:
■ We obtain Var(e) + (k−b) Var(t) for correct guess
■ We obtain Var(e) + (k + b−2c) Var(t) if only first c < b bits correct
■ Correct guesses decrease the variance
■ Similar attacks on other public-key schemes
19 / 57
Square-and-Multiply (simplified)
■ Execution-time independent implementation
Set y ←1
For bits dk, dk−1, . . . , d0 of d:
y ←y2 mod n, z ←y
If di = 1:
y ←y·m mod n
Else:
z ←z·m mod n
Return y
■ Is this safe?

■ More switching ⇒more current
■ Operations correlate with current
■ Measuring current reveals the operations

Differential Power Analysis
■ Several thousand measurements
■ Selection function: split the traces based on the predicted value of one
cyphertext bit given the (sub)key guess
■ Compare the difference of the averages
of the two sets
■ Correct (sub)key guess has higher difference

Correlation Power Analysis
■ Again several thousand measurements
■ Model of the side channel vs. the real side channel
■ Correlation based on key hypothesis
■ Correct hypothesis has highest correlation
25 / 57
Padding Oracle Attacks
■ CBC-mode1 with PKCS7 padding:
Pi = DK(Ci) ⊕Ci−1, C0 = IV PKCS7-padding: last block has last n bytes equal to n
(decryption)
X X X X X X 0x02 0x02 X X X 0x05 0x05 0x05 0x05 0x05
■ Server reacts differently to different errors: bad padding vs. bad decryption

2Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption
26 / 57
Example
■ We encrypt two blocks, P1, P2, with 2 bytes of padding:
C1 = EK(P1 ⊕IV), C2 = EK(P2 ⊕C1)
where P2 ends in 0x02,0x02
■ Modifying C1 affects decryption of P2: P2 = DK(C2) ⊕C1
■ Change the last byte b−1 of C1 as b−1 ←b−1 ⊕z−1 ⊕0x01:
■ If the last byte of the original P2 is z−1, there is no padding error
■ Otherwise, there is a padding error
■ Try with all 256 possible values for z−1
■ Proceed by setting b−1 ←b−1 ⊕z−1 ⊕0x02,
b−2 ←b−2 ⊕z−2 ⊕0x02 and guessing z−2

■ We use the knowledge of

29 / 57
Rowhammer
■ Cells in DRAM need periodic refresh
■ When reading, the original content is destroyed and must be copied
back
■ Due to high density,
rapid access causes side effects:
■ Bits in adjacent rows can flip
■ Depends on the module
■ Unpredictable, but repeatable

How Flipping a Bit Helps
■ Flipping the superuser or NX-bit in a pagetable:
■ Access to kernel pages from userspace
■ Memory pages can be made executable
■ Remove write protection
■ Flipping a bit in ssh public key:
■ In .ssh/authorized_keys
■ New modulus can likely be factored
■ Compute the new private key and log in

Cache Timing Side Channel
■ Computation speed depends on the location of the data
■ In cache: fast. Not in cache: slow
■ Two common techniques of measuring:
■ Flush+Reload: Evict relevant data and check for reload, or
■ Prime&Probe: Check if own data got evicted due to cache collision
36 / 57
Attacking with Flush+Reload
■ Assumption: data-dependent code lies in different cache lines
■ Focus on the library code
■ Flush, wait and reload
■ Shorter time indicates the victim loaded it already
■ This is our side channel!
37 / 57
Flush+Reload attack on RSA
■ Assume the If and Else branches lie in different cache lines:
Set y ←1
For bits dk, dk−11, . . . , d0 of d:
y ←y2 mod n, z ←y
If di = 1:
y ←y·m mod n
Else:
z ←z·m mod n
Alignment determined
by compiler and
location in memory
Return y
■ Depending on the bit value di, different cache lines get used
38 / 57
Speculative Execution
■ Modern CPUs are superscalar: several execution units, long pipelines
■ Conditional branches present an issue:
branch target is unclear before the condition gets resolved
■ To increase speed, processor chooses the most likely branch instead of waiting
■ Correct choice speeds up the computation
■ Wrong choice causes a roll-back, but no loss otherwise: the processor would have to
wait for the correct target anyway
■ Similar problem with permissions check
■ Problem: roll-back leaves cache polluted

A Library Example: Setup
■ One central library
■ Requests can also be made through the department’s secretary
■ The books arrive at the secretary’s oﬀice the next day
■ The secretary validates the request before giving out the book
■ The books can be returned directly or to the secretary
■ If a book is already at the secretary, no request is made to the library
40 / 57
A Library Example: Goal
■ We want to find out the grade of the student John Doe
■ Grades are integers between 1 and 5
■ The secretary has access to all the grades
■ The secretary will only give out the requester’s grade
■ We get no answer if we ask directly
