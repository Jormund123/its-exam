Privacy
Definition The right of individuals to protect their personal lifes &
matters from the outside world and to determine which
information about itself should be known to others
(Westin & Kasem-Madani)
3/ 80
Personal Data
Definition Any information relating to an identified or identifiable
(Name, Address, ...) natural person
4/ 80
Principles of personal data processing
Lawfulness, fairness and transparency
Purpose limitation
Data minimization
Accuracy of processed data
Storage limitation
Integrity and confidentiality
5/ 80
Attribute Types
(Direct) Identifiers
Identify an in individual directly
Examples
Name
Address
Identity number
6/ 80
Quasi-Identifiers
Population U
Table T with attributes Ai: T (A1, ..., An)
Forward function: fv : U →T
Backward funcion: fr : T →U ′
, U ′⊆U
Definition
A Quasi-Identifier QT is a subset of attributes
(Aj , ..., Ak) ⊆(A1, ..., An), which are sufficient to identify an
individual: fr(fv(pi[QT ])) = pi
7/ 80
Sensitive Attributes
Attributes whose values are considered sensitive somehow and are
worth to be protected
Examples:
Salary
Disease
...
8/ 80
Privacy Threats
Membership disclosure
The attacker gains information about whether data concerning an
individual is contained in a data set
Means not necessarily leakage of more information (e.g. sensitive
attributes)
Threat relies on leakage of meta information
E.g. data set is about cancer patients
9/ 80
Attribute disclosure
Leakage of sensitive attributes
May cause discomfort or harm to affected individuals
Illnesses or political convictions
Attribute disclosure is possible without matching an individual
to a record (We will see this later)
10/ 80
Identity disclosure
The attacker is able to match an individual to a record of the data
set
Result: Leakage of all attribute values
11/ 80
Anonymization: Attacker Models
Prosecutor
Intends to gain information about a specific individual
Assumption: Knows that the individual is contained in the
dataset
Journalist
Intends to gain information about a specific individual
Assumption: No background knowledge whether the
individual is contained in the dataset
Marketer
Intends to re-identify a large number of individuals
Constraint: An Attack is only considered successful if a larger
fraction of the individuals is re-identified 12/ 80
Privacy enhancing technologies
13/ 80
Pseudonymization
Personal data may no longer be attributed to individuals
without the use of additional information
which must be kept separately
where technical or organizational measures ensure that no
reidentification is possible
Effort for reidentification is relatively high
14/ 80
Pseudonymization: Examples
Mandy 0704 ↔Mandy Miller
Pseudonymization: Additional information reidentifies
0704Abr4753 ←Decryption →Mandy Miller
Pseudonymization: Additional information reidentifies
Hash:A4797UTZ ←Mandy Miller
Pseudonymization: Hashing of values reidentifies
15/ 80
Anonymization
„information which does not relate to an identified or identifiable
natural person“
„personal data rendered anonymous in such a manner that the
data subject is not or no longer identifiable“
Effort for reidentification is excessively high
Anonymous data is not personal data anymore, thus the GDPR
needs not to be accounted

Synthetic data
17/ 80
Perturbative Methods
Alter the attribute values in a way that the new data set may
contain erroneous information
E.g. add noise following a normal distribution
Age = 23, Noise = 4 →Age = 27
18/ 80
Non-Perturbative Methods
Replace attribute values with less specific than incorrect values
Detail reduction
E.g. Interval
Age = 23 →Age = [20-25]
19/ 80
Synthetic data
Replace attribute values by artificially created values
May be based on a model of the real data

Perturbative: Microaggregation
Replace a group of values with a summary statistic, e.g. mean
Clustering possible (replace values by centroid)
For numerical data types
Univariate: Microaggregation per attribute (no k-anonymity
ensured)

Non-Perturbative: Generalization
In the original table, every attribute value is as specific as possible
Values are called to be in the ground domain
Generalizing attribute values means making them less specific
Generalization hierarchies may be defined
Global vs local recoding
Global recoding: All occurrences of a value are replaced by
the same generalized value
Local recoding: Values are replaced by generalizations based
on their respective subset they belong to

Remove data completely from the table
May be used to adapt the necessary level of generalization
Outliers may be removed if they would cause a very high
generalization level

k-Anonymity
Definition In a released dataset, every occuring combination of values
of quasi-identifiers must occur for at least k individuals
These groups of at least k entries are called equivalence classes
k must be bigger than 1

k-Anonymity: Unsorted Matching Attack
Entries in published datasets have an order
Different published k-anonymous versions of the original table
may be linked
The linked (combined) table may destroy the k-anonymity
Solution:Mix the entries of a table before publishment

Attack
Previous attack: Only quasi-identifiers in table
Real world: More attributes than quasi-identifiers
Every published table may reveal additional information, even
when fulfilling k-anonymity
The linked (combined) table may destroy the k-anonymity
Solution:Consider all attributes of a published table T as a
quasi-identifier or base publishments on T

Definition: l-Diversity
An equivalence class is said to fulfill l-diversity if at least l
„well-represented“values for the sensitive attribute occur
in it.
A table is said to meet the l-diversity requirement if all its
equivalence classes are l-diverse.
l must be bigger than 1

l-Diversity: „Well-represented“?
Distinct l-diversity
Entropy l-diversity
Recursive (c, l)-diversity
45/ 80
Distinct l-diversity
For distinct l-diversity „well-represented“ means that there are at
least l different values for a sensitive attribute in each equivalence
class.

Distinct l-diversity is only fulfilled for olive and pink equivalence
class
Thus not for the whole table
47/ 80
Entropy l-diversity
Entropy of an equvalence class E is defined as
Entropy(E) =−
s∈S
p(E, s)log(p(E, s))
S: Domain of sensitive attribute
p(E, s): fraction of records in E with sensitive attribute s
To fulfill the „well-represented“ property, each equivalence class
must have Entropy(E) ≥log(l)

Recursive (c, l)-diversity
Most frequent value should not occur too often
Less frequent values should not occur too rarely
(c, l)-diversity(E) is fulfilled if the following inequality holds
r1 < c(rl + rl+1 +... + rm)
m: number of values in an equivalence class
ri, 1 ≤ri ≤m number of occurences of the ith most
frequent value in E
(c, l)-diversity holds for the whole table if it holds for all its
equivalence classes

t-Closeness
Definition: An equivalence class is said to fulfill t-closeness if the dis-
tributions of sensitive attributes in this class and the whole
table differ by at least t.
A table is said to meet the t-closeness requirement if all
its equivalence classes are t-close.

Based on point & permute
Top row of a garbled table is known as it is sorted by the sorting
bits
Choose the output label in the top row such that it results in a
zero-bitstring with length N
As the top row of the resulting garbled table is known to be 0 it
does not need to be transmitted to Bob
Transmitted table size is reduced by 1 for each gate
