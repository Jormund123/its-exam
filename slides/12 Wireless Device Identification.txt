On the example RF Device Identification
 RF Fingerprinting
 Identify devices based on the RF characteristics of their transmissions
 Most often hardware-specific, where the wireless chip adds some form of individual effect
 Imperfections in manufacturing lead to slight deviations in frequency, transmission power, clock skew,
etc.
 Very hard to forge a specific RF fingerprint

Using Device Identification for Authentication
▪ Identification using unique IDs
▪ Authentication: proving that a user/device is genuinely who that user/device claims to be
▪ Authorization: checking legitimate permission
See: Jagannath: A Comprehensive Survey on RF Fingerprinting: Traditional Approaches, Deep Learning, and Open Challenges (2015)

Device Identification Basics
scenarios, layers, characteristics
Scenario
 In a typical scenario
 The fingerprinter observes traffic to and from a targeted device (fingerprintee) in order to find
characteristics that (uniquely) distinguish the device or its components
 Fingerprinting looks for characteristics in all layers
 Observables depend on communication and technology
 i.e. Wi-Fi provides other observable characteristics than cellular networks do
IT Security – Wireless Security – Daniel Vogel – 15.01.2026
17
FP characteristics per layer
IT Security – Wireless Security – Daniel Vogel – 15.01.2026
18
Characteristics
 Collect characteristics to be used as Device Identificating Data (DID) or fingerprint
 Device identifiers such as MAC, IMEI, etc.
 Differences in software implementations of specs (i.e. 802.11, features, behavior, etc.)
 Hardware imperfections (see RF fingerprinting)
 Direct DID:
 DID that qualify for device identification by themselves
 Indirect DID:
 DID that by themselves are not enough but can help gathering additional info on the targeted device

19
Classification of Characteristics
 Classification of the characteristics (fingerprints)
 Typically by means of some standard classifier
 When the number of devices is known in advance: Nearest Neighbor Classifier
 Classification Error Rate (ER)
 % of misclassified test FP over total of test FP

Device Identification Techniques
passive and active identification
Passive vs active identification
 Passive identification methods:
 Only observing the communication traffic of the TD
 Dependent on communication state the TD is in (devices connected to a/your network may be more
talkative and provide additional information)
 Active identification methods:
 Generating purpose-built traffic with the TD and then observe their behavior
 Also dependent on communication state the TD is in
 Sometimes TD can be tricked into connecting to the attackers network, thus leaking additional info
IT Security – Wireless Security – Daniel Vogel – 15.01.2026
34
Passive identification techniques by packet evaluation
IT Security – Wireless Security – Daniel Vogel – 15.01.2026
35
Signal intelligence vs packet evaluation
 RF Signal Intelligence (SIGINT) is its own research field
 Extracting signal characteristics such as modulation, bandwidth, frequency, protocols etc. from
unknown RF signals in the spectrum of interest
 SIGINT methods can be utilized in device identification
 We’re basically looking at the signal, not the content
 Packet evaluation looks at the content transmitted by the signal
 Symbols, bit entropy, encoding, header info, actual payload, etc.

Passive DI: Transient-based approaches
 Signal ramps up from channel noise to full power before a new transmission
 The time between the start of ramping up to full power is called the transient signal

46
Passive DI: Approaches not using packet content
 Approaches so far are not using the packet’s contents for DI
 We can use different parts of signals and derive identifying metrics
 From preambles, transient, steady-state signals
 From modulation errors
 From relative signal power and Channel State Information (CSI)
 Usually best suited to identify specific devices with specific chips that classifiers have been trained for

48
Passive DI: Approaches using Scrambler-seeds
 Scrambling encodes a packet before transmitting, reverted by a descrambler at the receivers side
 Ensure that the sent signal has certain desired properties for transmitting and receiving
 High entropy, reduce packet loss, make identical packets be transmitted differently, makes signal
power spectrum independent of transmitted data
 Usually done by generating a pseudo-random bitstring added on top of the actual data stream (LFSR)
 Not to be confused with encryption
 Encryption typically happens digitally, scrambling not (always) with the intention to provide
confidentiality

53
Passive DI: Approaches using Identifiers
 The most obvious and trivial way to identify devices: use device identifiers
 Protocols use device identifiers to enable device addressability, e.g. MAC address, IMEI, WPS UUID
 Assuming the content of frame or packet headers are understandable by an eavesdropper
 We can look into the header format and extract direct DIDs straight from there
 If these identifiers are not changed from frame to frame per device, reidentification is possible
 MAC headers may be sent unencryptedly, so eavesdropping may be possible
 Obvious problem for device privacy, so there are some countermeasures known
 e.g. MAC randomization

54
Passive DI: Approaches using Information Elements (IEs)
 IEs are a Wi-Fi specific part of the protocol
 Some IEs are mandatory for the protocol to function
 Many are optional, hinting at capabilities for other
participating device to allow certain features to be
used
 Certain combinations of IEs will de-anonymize devices
even when the MAC-address is randomized
→ exercise
 e.g. Probe Request FP, SSID FP [8]

 Vanhoef fingerprinting using IEs [8]
 Extract tags of existing IEs in PR to note existence
and order of used IEs
 For each IE: note name and value as string
→ concatenate into a single FP string
 String compare allows to filter for packets using
the exact same IE tags and IE values

Passive DI recap
 Passive device identification means listening in on packets sent by devices over the shared medium and
using these packets to extract DID
 DID can either be extracted by examining the received signal and its properties or by examining the
packet and its contents
 Some approaches theoretically work on any RF transmission, if a large enough knowledge base was there
to distinguish between all possible devices
 Some approaches are protocol specific and require devices to behave in a certain way, e.g. send their
MAC address in clear, use QPSK, use predictable scrambler seeds
 Very few approaches provide direct DIDs and are generally easy to use
 In practice: Devices want to be identified to use services, so they provide identifying information
IT Security – Wireless Security – Daniel Vogel – 15.01.2026
59
Active DI
 Active identification methods:
 Generating purpose-built traffic with the TD and then observe their behavior
 Also dependent on communication state the TD is in
 Sometimes TD can be tricked into connecting to the attackers network, thus leaking additional info
 We actively engage the TD in order to have them send us/the network packets we can use for
identification/tracking
IT Security – Wireless Security – Daniel Vogel – 15.01.2026
60
MAC Randomization and why it’s a problem
 Communication in heterogeneous networks like wireless networks requires addressability
 Communication protocols use device identifiers to make devices addressable
 MAC addresses are used for many different protocols, i.e. Wi-Fi, Bluetooth
 Sending the device MAC in clear all the time allows for addressability but also easy tracking
IT Security – Wireless Security – Daniel Vogel – 15.01.2026
61
MAC Randomization and why it’s a problem
 A commonly used countermeasure is MAC randomization
 Instead of the global MAC address that identifies the RF chip a random MAC address is sent with the
packets
 Packets with a randomized MAC are not (easily) matched to individual devices anymore
 Doesn’t this also make these devices not addressable anymore?

 Packets with a randomized MAC are not (easily) matched to individual devices anymore
 Doesn’t this also make these devices not addressable anymore?
 YES and NO, not all sent packets need to be matched to an individual device to serve the purpose
 i.e. Probe requests are used for network discovery, not for network connections
 In general: When connection is not the purpose, any MAC suffices
IT Security – Wireless Security – Daniel Vogel – 15.01.2026
63
MAC Randomization: global vs local MAC
 MAC randomization is not part of any specification
 There is no clear instruction when and where and how to use it or if at all and for what packets etc
 We define the MAC address that the RF chip is identified by as the global MAC address
 Since randomized MACs can be used if the purpose is not to connect, how do devices get addressable
when a connection is desired?
 They can fall back to the global MAC address and use it for any connection (attempts)
 They can also use a randomized address for a connection, if it doesn’t change during the connection
 We call this a local MAC address or a session MAC address

MAC Randomization identification
 How do we identify an observed MAC address as a randomized MAC?
 MAC randomization is not part of any specification
 In Wi-Fi: next to last Bit of the first MAC Byte is called universal/local Bit
 If MAC global: set to 0
 If MAC local: set to 1

67
MAC Randomization identification
 Different vendors implement MAC randomization differently
 Not all implementations respect the universal/local Bit
 Apple devices randomize all 47 Bits
 Android devices vary in their implementation
 Many devices only randomize the NIC,
leaving the OUI intact
 We can often still determine the vendor

68
Active DI vs MAC Randomization
 We don’t really need active DI when we can observe direct DID passively
 Most active DI techniques are basically attacks on MAC Randomization or other protection
mechanisms
 Some aim to increase the amount of traffic generated
 General idea is mostly the same: send a ”stimulus” packet and observe response or the lack of a response

Active DI: Bluetooth Randomization
 Randomized Bluetooth MACs update at a different interval than the content of the sent packets
 This allows to track bluetooth devices through MAC randomization as long as the observation is
somewhat gapless

 Application Layer FP can be circumvented by changing the application parameters
 Physical Layer FP is more difficult to compromise due to inherent physical properties
 Good features are very difficult to find and collect
 Active DI
 More flexible approaches and allows to explore different scenarios
 Easier to detect from the authority

Summary Device Identification
 Techniques for device identification span all network layers for a variety of objectives (defensive or
offensive)
 The accuracy of identification depends on many factors (i.e. hardware, experimental conditions, features
and classification procedures)
 There is comparably little work on the resilience of identification with respect to the above and other
attacks
 Major research interest as wireless devices get more and more ubiquitous
 Identifying a device often also identifies the person carrying it
