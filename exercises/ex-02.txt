Exercise 1 (ret2libc, 4 points). Consider the compiled binary task1 and its source code task1
.c. Exploit the buffer overflow in the program by returning into system with /bin/sh. Extend
the scaffold in task1-exploit.py to generate your exploit bytes.
Note that the binary is statically linked, so ASLR is not relevant. Other mitigations have
been disabled as well.
Exercise 2 (Return-oriented Programming, 6 points). Extend the script task2-exploit.py
by writing a ROP-chain to exploit the buffer overflow in task2 to create the file /tmp/pwned.
You find the source code in task2.c. Be aware that this time ASLR is active!
Hint: An additional pipeline job calls ROPgadget on glibc for you, so you do not need to think
about getting the correct version of the library. Furthermore, another job fetches the offset of
some symbols and strings.
Important: While you are technically not limited, you should only interact immediately with
the binary with basic IO. Other interactions with the system like reading the process memory
map, libraries or directly creating the target file will lead to point deductions. This includes
most of the ROP-specific tools shipped by pwntools.
Note: The pipeline image is based on the ubuntu:jammy docker image. This might help you with
debugging your solutions locally.
Note 2: The pipeline for task 2 seems to occasionally fail without an obvious reason — even
for the sample solutions. If you are pretty convinced your solution should work, you can try
triggering the pipeline job again.
