Figure 1: Persistence diagram of a point cloud sampled
from an unknown shape.
Figure 2: Simplical complex
Exercise 1 (Topological Data Analysis - Theory, 1+1 points). Solve the following subtasks and
submit your solution as theory.txt or theory.pdf:
a) What does the persistence diagram in Figure 1 tell you about the underlying point cloud?
What shape could the point cloud be sampled from?
b) Consider Figure 2. What is the corresponding abstract simplex complex? How many zero-
and one-dimensional holes does the complex have?
Exercise 2 (Persistent Homology - Practice, 3+3 points). In this exercise you will compute
the persistent homology of given point clouds. To this end, familiarize yourself with the gudhi1
library and its documentation. Use the seed 42 where applicable.
a) Given the point cloud stored in torus.csv, compute its Vietoris-Rips complex and its per-
sistent homology up to dimension three. Visualize the corresponding persistence diagram
and barcodes. Submit your script as torus.py, and the persistence diagram and barcodes
as torus-diagram.png and torus-barcode.png, respectively.

b) In the folder iot_behavior you find 174 point clouds, each represented by a CSV file. Each
file contains 50 data points describing the behavior of an IoT device in comparison to four
other homogeneous devices over a time period of t. Write a Python script iot.py that
computes the persistent homology of the Vietoris-Rips complex of each point cloud and
then generates a 2D embedding employing multidimensional scaling (MDS)2 based on the
pairwise Bottleneck distances between the dimension 1 persistence diagrams. Visualize the
resulting embedding using the labels to color the points. In addition to your script, submit
the embedding as mds.csv (without labels, header, and index), and the visualization as
iot.png.
Exercise 3 (Mapper, 1+1 points). Topological data analysis also finds applications in ex-
ploratory data analysis. In the following, you will get to know the Mapper algorithm, which is
a method for visualizing high-dimensional data sets. To this end, familiarize yourself with the
kmapper3 library and its documentation. Use the seed 42 where applicable.
a) Describe in your own words (not more than 300 words) how the Mapper algorithm works.
You may use diagrams to illustrate your explanation. Submit your answer as mapper.txt
or mapper.pdf:
b) The file phishing.csv contains a data set describing characteristics of phishing websites.
Write a Python script, that uses kmapper to visualize the dataset. Your script should uti-
lize Principal Component Analysis4 as a lens (projection) into 3D space. The clusterer
should be AgglomerativeClustering5 with metric="euclidean", linkage="complete
", and n_clusters=3. Submit your scripts phishing.py and the resulting HTML file
phishing.html.
Bonus: Experiment with different parametrization for both mapper as well as the projec-
tion and clustering algorithm.
