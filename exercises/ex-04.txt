Exercise 1 (Distributed Group Key Management, 1.5+1+1 points).
Lightning Survey
Figure 1: Key tree of the TGDH protocol
The users u1, u2, u3, u4, and u5 apply the Tree-based Group Diffie-Hellman (TGDH) protocol
with the key tree shown in Figure 1 for the group key establishement. For TGDH the group
Z∗
37 with generator g = 2. Assuming that the following keys are stored in the leaves: k3,0 = 9,
k3,1 = 5, k2,1 = 8, k2,2 = 17, k2,3 = 27.
a) The user u6 with the key k = 19 joins the key tree in Figure 1. Hence, k2,1 moves to k3, 2.
Draw the modified tree and calculate the group key.
b) Write down the messages of the sponsor.
c) Now the user u5 leaves the group. Hence, the user u4 alters his private key to˜
k1,1 = 10.
Calculate the new group key.
Exercise 2 (Secret Sharing, 1+1+1.5 points).
a) Explain the two different types of secret sharing from the lecture.
b) A one-time pad is the simplest 2-out-of-2 secret-sharing algorithm. Only the authorized
set of users u1 and u2 can reconstruct the secret. Specify the algorithm and reconstruct
the message from the shares s1 := 0110000011 and s2 := 1011010111.
c) Assuming five users ui, i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and a (3,5)-threshold sharing algorithm with the
polynomial f (x) = 15x2 + 14x + 6 mod 17. Calculate a share for each user. Show that
the secret can be restored by using the key shares of users u1, u2, u3. (useful calculation
rules: (−a) mod b = (kb− a) mod b, https://de.planetcalc.com/8329/).

Figure 2: Four transactions in Bitcoin
Exercise 3 (Blockchain-based Distributed Ledger, 1+1+1 points).
a) Explain the basic operation of the blockchain-based distributed ledger Bitcoin.
b) The difficulty is also part of the block header. Explain why the difficulty of the hash
puzzle changes regularly. What negative effects can occur if this does not happen (name
four disadvantages)?
c) In Bitcoin the four transactions in Figure 2 are processed. Calculate the balance for each
user after Tx4 and create a transaction Tx5 in the format of Figure 2 where the user A
sends 5 coins to user B.
