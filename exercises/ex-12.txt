Exercise 1 (Device Identification per Layer, 2 points). Device identification can be done on
different layers, depending on use case and used protocols.
Describe a scenario where application layer device identification must be used, as device identi-
fication on lower layers wouldn’t work, and explain why (max 4 sentences). Write your solutions
into task1.txt.
Exercise 2 (Passive and Active Device Identification, 2 points). Which of these requirements
must be met for passive device identification to succeed? Mark with True or False. Extend
task2.yml with your solution.
The fingerprinter must have a sensitive receiver set up, such that signals sent by the target
device can be received sufficiently by that receiver.
The target device must not move out of the fingerprinter’s range.
There must be DID observable.
Target devices can only be identified as a specific device, if a correctly trained classifier
for that device is used.
Decide whether the following statements are True or False. Active device identification ...
only works in environments, where the target device is willing to connect to the finger-
printer’s network.
only works in environments, where the target device is willing to connect to another existing
network.
is only used to identify target devices that use MAC address randomization.
requires the target device to respond to messages.
Exercise 3 (Wi-Fi-based Device Identification, 6 points). For your perimeter, you have set
up a Wi-Fi based intrusion detection system. You received an alert by your system that an
intruding device has been detected. The system provided you with its Wi-Fi trace around the
incident, where the packet with the number 3083 of the Target Device (TD) has been marked
as suspicious.
Analyze the given pcap (see wisec.pcap) to learn more about the intruding device. Use script
.py to implement a Wi-Fi based IE fingerprinting method akin to the one proposed by Vanhoef1
.

Wi-Fi network discovery mechanisms.” Proceedings of the 11th ACM on Asia conference on computer and

Calculate the fingerprint of that suspicious packet. Use that fingerprint to isolate all packets
sent by the TD from all other packets not sent by it and solve the following tasks. Write your
solution into task3.txt.
a) Calculate the fingerprint of the TD. State that fingerprint.
b) How many probe requests have been observed from the TD using that fingerprint?
c) State the first and last timestamp of these observed probe requests of the TD (YYYY-
MM-DD hh:mm:ss).
d) State your observation towards the MAC address of the TD.
e) Which SSIDs did the TD probe for?
f) Describe the behavior of the observed RSSI measured for all packets received from the
TD.
g) What is the average rate with which the TD sent its probe requests during the observed
time period? Towards what change in its transmission state does the probe request rate
hint for the TD?
Hints: You do not need to use sequence numbers for this task. The fingerprint of the first packet
in wisec.pcap should be looking something like this: 0,1,50,3,45,127,107,supra:02040b16,
extrates:0c1218243048606c,htcap:402d,htmcs:00000000000000000000000000ffffff,
htext:0000,httx:00000000,htasel:00,htampdu:1b,interworking:0f
Note: You are not limited to use the given script.py, if you prefer not to use Python. If not
using the given script.py, if your solution does not match the expected solution, no further
points will be awarded. The given script.py handles access to the .pcap file. You will need to
use the scapy library.
