Part 1: Flavius
Exercise 1 (Flavius Introduction, 1+1 points). This exercise helps you to get familiar with
handing in your submissions via Flavius and Gitlab. Be aware that all your work needs to be
pushed to the branch corresponding to the current sheet. Furthermore, all of your files for all
tasks of a sheet need to be located inside the sheet’s folder (in this case flavius_hf).
a) Create a file with the name this-is-simple.txt
b) Check the pipeline output of the first task. Adjust the content of the file accordingly.
Part 2: Practical Challenges in Human Factors in Security and Privacy
