Exercise 1 (Intrusion Kill Chain for event-stream, 2 points). Provide a brief, concise description
(2 sentences maximum) of each step in the intrusion kill chain for the software supply chain
attack using event-stream. Write your solution into event-stream.txt.
Exercise 2 (Analyze Malicious Package, 3.5 points). Analyze the malicious package browserift
(already in your repo) to answer the following questions:
a) What triggers the execution?
b) Is it specific to a certain operating system? If yes, which and why?
c) What obfuscation technique is used to hide the malicious code?
d) What is the objective of the attack?
e) How is that objective achieved, i.e. implemented?
f) What was the attack vector?
g) What is the latest version of the package in the npm package registry?
We’ve disarmed crucial parts, but you probably shouldn’t run it anyway. Write your solution
into browserift.txt with no more than a line per subtask.
Exercise 3 (Capture the Flag using a malicious Package, 4.5 points). Write a proof of concept
package that is able to exfiltrate a certain environment variable (flag) of the submission pipeline.
Craft an npm (JavaScript/Node.js v12) package1 named poc-itsec and version 1.0.0. When
done, create a tarball using npm pack. We will install your package using npm install poc-
itsec-1.0.0.tgz and subsequently execute the main script using node ./node_modules/poc
-itsec. But be aware that we have implemented rudimentary detection capabilities! Check
the pipeline output to validate your solution and make sure the value of the flag ITSEC{...} is
visible on stdout.
