Exercise 1 (Analysis Methods, 0 points).
(i) Name and explain 2 challenges when working with traditional analysis methods (e.g.
fuzzing, static analysis).
(ii) Name and explain 2 challenges when working with LLMs.
Write your solutions into task1.txt.
Exercise 2 (Approaches and Paradigms, 0 points).
In your own words, explain the fuzzing-first and LLM-first design paradigms. Then, try to assign
each of the seven AIxCC finalist teams and WASPS to one of these two paradigms. If you think
that one or more teams do not clearly fit into either category, explain your reasoning and, if
possible, suggest an alternative category.
Write your solutions into task2.txt.
Exercise 3 (Hands-on Reasoning, 0 points).
WASPS’s CRS is in the process of being open-sourced. To help ensure that the system is easy
to use, we would appreciate your feedback via this survey
https://forms.gle/s4H4q4Eoc4TzZ9Lx6.
The survey will guide you step by step through setting up and running the CRS on an example
project. We invite you to share logs and artifacts by uploading them to your repository.
